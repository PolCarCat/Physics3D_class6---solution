# RACING GAME

Pol Carrera & Marc Moreno

### Getting Started

These game is a procedural generated racing game, the objective is to beat the current record in a limited time.
There are obstacles and powerups, there are two types of powerups, the blue spheres and the green spheres, the blue ones
give an extra boost to the car and the green ones gives extra time.

### Controlls

```
Arrows: Movement
Intro: start the game
R: Reset
Space Reposize the car
```

### Issues

We tried to implement a 2D renderer to implement a decent UI made in SDL but we had to give up on that and we end up 
with a Open GL basic structure.
